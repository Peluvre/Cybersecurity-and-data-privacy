## Comparing specs to a working system

- *A registered user can be a reserver or an administrator* : XSS vulnerabilities could allow attackers to escalate their privilege and become an administrator.
- *A reserver can book a resource if they are over 15 years old* : The validation of age is weak so we can bypass the age restriction.
- *The reserverâ€™s identity is not shown when viewing booked resources without logging in* : XSS in JSON responses may make it possible to reveal reserver identities.
